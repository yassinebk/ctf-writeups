## Why DVCS Pillage Toolkit? ##
I thought it would be useful to automate some other techniques I found to extract code, configs and other information from a git,hg, and bzr repo's identified in a web root that was not 100% cloneable. Each script extracts as much knowledge about the repo as possible through predictable file names and known object hashes, etc.


## gitpillage.sh requirements ##

Basic requirements usually fulfilled by any *nix system.

* bash
* wget or curl
* grep
* awk


## gitpillage.sh Usage ##
    gitpillage.sh hostname/directory
    (directory is optional)

Example:

    `gitpillage.sh www.example.com/images (would crawl http://example.com/images/.git/)`

    `gitpillage.sh www.example.com (would crawl http://example.com/.git/)`


## hgpillage requirements ##
