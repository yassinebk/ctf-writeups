# LemonLDAP::NG

LemonLDAP::NG is a complete and modular Web-SSO system that can run with
reverse-proxies or directly on application webservers. It can be used in
conjunction with OpenID-Connect, CAS and SAML systems as identity or
service provider. It can also be used as proxy between those federation
systems.

It manages both authentication and authorization and provides headers for
accounting. So you can have a full AAA protection. Authorizations are built by
associating a regular expression and a rule. Regular expression is applied on
the requested URL and the rule calculates if the user is authorized.
