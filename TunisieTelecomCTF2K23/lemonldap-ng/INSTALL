                          LEMONLDAP::NG INSTALLATION

Lemonldap::NG is a modular Web-SSO based on Apache::Session modules. It
simplifies the build of a protected area with a few changes in the application.
It manages both authentication and authorization and provides headers for
accounting. So you can have a full AAA protection.

See README file to known how it works.

----------------------
I - QUICK INSTALLATION
----------------------

The proposed example use a protected site named test.example.com. Non
authenticated users are redirected to auth.example.com.

1.1 - PREREQ
------------

1.1.1 - Software

To use Lemonldap::NG, you have to run a LDAP server and of course an Apache
server compiled with mod-perl (version 1.3 or 2.x). Generaly, the version of
Apache proposed with your Linux distribution match, but some distributions used
an experimental version of mod_perl with Apache2 (mod_perl-1.99) which does
not work with Lemonldap::NG. With such distributions (like Debian-3.1), you
have to use Apache-1.3 or to use a mod_perl backport (www.backports.org
package for Debian works fine).

1.1.2 - Perl prereq

Perl modules: use `perl scripts/dependencies-list.pl` to see needed list

With Debian:
  apt-get build-dep lemonldap-ng

1.2 - BUILDING
--------------

1.2.1 - Complete install

  $ tar xzf lemonldap-ng-*.tar.gz
  $ cd lemonldap-ng-*
  $ make && make test
  $ sudo make install

By default, all is installed in /usr/local/lemonldap-ng except Perl libraries
which are installed in a directory included in @INC.

Documentation is then available in /usr/local/lemonldap-ng/doc

1.2.2 - Install on Debian

  $ tar xzf lemonldap-ng-*.tar.gz
  $ cd lemonldap-ng-*
  $ debuild
  $ sudo dpkg -i ../*lemonldap-ng*.deb

Here, all is installed in /var/lib/lemonldap-ng, /etc/lemonldap-ng except Perl
libraries which are installed in /usr/share/perl5/Lemonldap/NG/

Documentation is then available in /usr/share/doc/lemonldap-ng
