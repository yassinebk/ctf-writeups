	- In VirtualHost context, PerlInitHandler is an alias for
	  PerlPostReadRequestHandler. So by encoding characters (%40 for 'a'),
	  users can bypass some restrictions.
	  Now PerlInitHandler is replaced by PerlHeaderParserHandler, so
	  Lemonldap::NG is called after URI translation phase.
	- Correction of a bug in internal redirections: now internal
	  redirections are not examined: for example, http://test.example.com/
	  is internaly redirected to /index.pl, but only the first request (/)
